## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To add `CRUD File Manager` to your Swift project using Swift Package Manager, add the following dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/KDTechniques/crud-file-manager-swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

## üìñ Usage

### Creating an Instance

Import the package and create an instance of `CRUDFileManager` with a type that conforms to `RawRepresentable & Sendable` where `RawValue` is `String`.

```swift
import CRUDFileManager

let fileManager = CRUDFileManager<YourSubDirectoriesType>()
```

Replace `YourSubDirectoriesType` with a type that meets the above requirements.

```swift
enum YourSubDirectoriesType: String {
    case exampleSubDir1
    case exampleSubDir2
    case exampleSubDir3
    ...
}
```

### Creating a Directory

Create a directory at the specified location. This function will create the directory if it does not exist.

```swift
do {
    let directoryURL = try fileManager.createDirectory(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir]
    )
    print("Directory created at: \(directoryURL)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to create directory: \(error)")
}
```

### Creating a File

Create a file at the specified location with the given contents.

```swift
do {
    let fileURL = try fileManager.createFile(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir],
        nameWithExt: "example.txt",
        contents: Data("Hello, world!".utf8)
    )
    print("File created at: \(fileURL)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to create file: \(error)")
}
```

### Reading a File

Read the contents of a file at the specified location.

```swift
do {
    let data = try fileManager.readFile(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir],
        nameWithExt: "example.txt"
    )
    let contents = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
    print("File contents: \(contents)")
} catch {
    print("Failed to read file: \(error)")
}
```

### Updating a File

Update the contents of an existing file at the specified location.

```swift
do {
    try fileManager.updateFile(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir],
        nameWithExt: "example.txt",
        contents: Data("Updated content.".utf8)
    )
    print("File updated.")
} catch {
    print("Failed to update file: \(error)")
}
```

### Deleting a File

Delete a file at the specified location.

```swift
do {
    try fileManager.deleteFile(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir],
        nameWithExt: "example.txt"
    )
    print("File deleted.")
} catch {
    print("Failed to delete file: \(error)")
}
```

### Deleting a Directory

Delete a directory and all its contents at the specified location.

```swift
do {
    try fileManager.deleteDirectory(
        directory: .documentDirectory,
        subDirectories: [.exampleSubDir]
    )
    print("Directory deleted.")
} catch {
    print("Failed to delete directory: \(error)")
}
```

## üö´ Error Handling

The `CRUD File Manager` package defines custom error types in the `ErrorTypes_Enum` enum:

- `pathDoesNotExist(String)`: The path does not exist.
- `pathAlreadyExists(String)`: The path already exists.
- `fileCreationFailed(String)`: File creation failed.
- `fileReadFailed(String)`: File read failed.

These errors provide descriptive messages to help with debugging issues related to file paths and operations.
